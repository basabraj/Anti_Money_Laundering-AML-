#  Anti-Money Laundering using Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN)

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** by modeling banking transactions as a **dynamic graph** and identifying suspicious accounts using a **Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN)**.
Unlike traditional rule-based systems, the model learns **evolving transaction relationships over time**, enabling more accurate detection of complex money-laundering patterns.

The system is implemented using **PyTorch** and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## Key Features

*  Transaction modeling as a **directed temporal graph**
*  TGNN-style **message passing + GRU temporal learning**
*  Detection of **suspicious accounts**
*  Model evaluation using **AUC** and **Precision@K**

---

##  Model Architecture (TGNN-Style)

1. **Graph Construction**

   * Nodes → Bank accounts
   * Edges → Transactions (sender → receiver)

2. **Message Passing**

   * Each account aggregates information from neighboring accounts

3. **Temporal Modeling**

   * A **GRU** captures how transaction behavior evolves over time

4. **Prediction**

   * Binary classification: **Normal / Suspicious**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)** – overall discrimination capability
* **Precision@K** – effectiveness of detecting top-K risky accounts

These metrics are displayed directly in the dashboard.

---

## Dataset

* Example dataset used:

  * `manual_aml_1000x1000.csv` (synthetically generated)
* Expected CSV format:

  ```csv
  sender,receiver,amount,timestamp
  ```

---

##  Streamlit Application

The web app allows users to:

* Upload a banking transaction dataset
* Visualize transaction graphs
* View suspicious accounts
* Inspect AUC and Precision@K scores

###  Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
